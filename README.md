# RainIQ

> *"Every drop, counted."*

**RainIQ** is an Android app that transforms rainwater harvesting from a passive, untracked activity into a data-driven, measurable habit. It helps households log daily rainfall, calculate actual water harvested using a verified engineering formula, visualize savings through an animated water tank, and get AI-powered tips via Google Gemini.

## 📐 Core Formula

```
Water Harvested (L) = Roof Area (sq ft) × Rainfall (mm) × 0.0929 × Runoff Coefficient
```

**Runoff Coefficients by roof type:**
| Roof Material | Coefficient |
|---------------|-------------|
| Metal / Tin | 0.90 |
| Concrete / RCC | 0.85 |
| Clay Tiles | 0.75 |
| Asphalt | 0.70 |
| Other | 0.65 |
