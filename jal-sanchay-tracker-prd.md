## 1. Executive Summary

Jal-Sanchay Tracker is an Android application that transforms rainwater harvesting from a passive, untracked activity into a data-driven, measurable habit. The app allows households to log daily rainfall, calculates actual water harvested using a verified engineering formula, visualizes savings through an animated water tank, and uses Google Gemini AI to generate personalized water-saving tips and garden planning suggestions. The app targets rural and semi-urban Indian households that practice or want to practice rainwater harvesting.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Many Indian households have rainwater harvesting infrastructure — rooftop gutters, storage tanks, sump pits — but have no way to quantify how effective their system is. Without data, conservation feels intangible, motivation decreases, and the full potential of the existing infrastructure is never realized. Citizens cannot answer basic questions like:

- "How many liters did I collect last monsoon?"
- "Is my roof size sufficient for my family's needs?"
- "What can I grow in my garden with the water I've saved?"

The absence of a simple, localized tracking tool means conservation remains aspirational rather than actionable.

---

## 3. Vision & Goal

**Vision:** Turn every Indian household's rooftop into a measurable, quantified water asset.

**Primary Goal:** Help users understand their water harvesting potential and track actual savings against that potential.

**Secondary Goal:** Use GenAI to make water conservation feel personal and rewarding, not like a chore.

**Internship Evaluation Goal:** Demonstrate proficiency in Android development (Room DB, RecyclerView, animations, WorkManager) combined with GenAI API integration (Gemini).

---

## 4. Target Users

| User Type | Description | Primary Need |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| **Primary** | Urban/semi-urban homeowner with existing rainwater harvesting setup | Track how much water they're actually saving |
| **Secondary** | Apartment resident curious about potential savings | Understand if rainwater harvesting is worth installing |
| **Tertiary** | Student / environmentally conscious user | Gamified conservation tracking |

**User Geography:** India (Karnataka focus, English UI with local context)  
**Device Target:** Mid-range Android (4GB RAM, Android 8.0+)  
**Connectivity:** Must work offline; AI features need internet

## 12. Core Formula & Logic

### Water Harvest Calculation

The core formula used throughout the app:

```
Liters Harvested = Roof Area (sq ft) × Rainfall (mm) × 0.0929 × Runoff Coefficient
```

**Where:**
- `0.0929` = conversion factor from sq ft to sq meters (1 sq ft = 0.0929 sq m)
- Runoff Coefficient accounts for evaporation, splash, and roof material absorption loss

**Example:**
```
Roof Area     = 1,000 sq ft
Rainfall      = 25 mm
Coefficient   = 0.85 (Concrete roof)

Liters = 1000 × 25 × 0.0929 × 0.85
       = 1974.25 liters
```

### Runoff Coefficient Reference Table

| Roof Material | Coefficient | Notes |
|--------------|-------------|-------|
| Metal/Tin | 0.90 | Least absorption |
| Concrete/RCC | 0.85 | Most common in India |
| Clay Tiles | 0.75 | Moderate absorption |
| Asphalt | 0.70 | |
| Other | 0.65 | Conservative default |

### Impact Conversion Formulas

| Metric | Formula |
|--------|---------|
| Household days | `Total Liters ÷ 135` |
| Borewell trips saved | `Total Liters ÷ 20` |
| Trees supported (weeks) | `Total Liters ÷ 75` |
| Money saved (INR) | `Total Liters × 5` |
| CO₂ reduced (kg) | `Total Liters × 0.001` |

## 13. Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- App launch time: Under 2 seconds (cold start)
- Dashboard animations: 60fps smooth rendering
- Room DB queries: Under 100ms for all read operations
- API response timeout: 10 seconds (show error after)

### Offline Behavior
- All core features (logging, history, dashboard, report) work fully offline
- AI Tips and Weather Forecast require internet; graceful error states shown
- Static pre-loaded tips always available on Screen 6

### Input Validation Rules
- All number inputs: reject non-numeric characters in real-time
- Rainfall range: 0.1mm — 500mm (warn above 300mm)
- Roof area range: 50 — 50,000 sq ft
- Tank capacity range: 100 — 1,000,000 liters
- Date: Cannot be in the future; cannot be before app install date

### Accessibility
- Minimum touch target: 48dp × 48dp for all buttons
- Content descriptions on all icons (for TalkBack)
- Text size respects system font size settings
- Color is never the sole indicator of state (use icons + text alongside color)

### Security
- Gemini and OpenWeatherMap API keys must NOT be hardcoded in source code
- Store API keys in `local.properties` and access via `BuildConfig`
- No user data transmitted to external servers (all data stored locally)

## 15. Out of Scope

The following features are explicitly excluded from this internship build to maintain focus:

- **Multi-user / household accounts** — single user only
- **Cloud sync or backend server** — all data is local on-device
- **Play Store publishing** — APK submission to evaluator only
- **iOS version** — Android only
- **Kannada localization** — English UI only (unlike Project #37)
- **Paid API tiers** — all integrations must remain within free limits
- **Bluetooth/IoT sensor integration** — manual rainfall input only
- **Social features or leaderboards** — achievements are local only
